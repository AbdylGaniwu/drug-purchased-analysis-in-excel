# Drug Purchase Analysis

This project analyses a dataset on drug performance for common conditions. By leveraging customer reviews, cost information, cost of use, satisfaction ratings, drug effectiveness and more. I aim to understand patient experiences and identify potential trends in drug use.

## Dataset Description:
•	Condition: Medical condition treated by the drug.
•	Drug: Name of the medication.
•	Indication: Purpose of the drug.
•	Purchase Type: Method of acquiring the drug (prescription (Rx), over-the-counter (OTC), etc.).
•	Reviews: Number of customer reviews associated with the drug.
•	Effectiveness: Customer-reported effectiveness score over 5.
•	Ease Of Use: Customer-reported ease of use score over 5.
•	Satisfaction: Customer-reported satisfaction score over 5.
•	Dosage Form: Physical form of the drug (tablet, capsule, etc.).
•	Price: Average price of the drug.

## Analysis Objectives and Insight:

1.	**Compare the Purchase type and quantity of drugs purchased:** 
Based on observation on the pie chart, most patients received a prescription (Rx) from a doctor, accounting for 70.66% of drug purchases. Over-the-counter (OTC) drugs were used by 24.53% of patients, while a small fraction relied on both prescription and OTC drugs. Less than 1% relied on other forms of either prescription or OTC drugs. The pie chart shows that prescriptions dominate, indicating patients' preference for a doctor's diagnosis and recommendation.

2.	**Which drug is more effective based on condition averagely?** 
Based on the line chart ratings, most patients rated the effectiveness of the drug as 5 and 4, indicating a high level of satisfaction with the effectiveness of the drugs based on what they are treating or managing in terms of condition.



3.	**What are the top 10 drugs reviewed?** 
Duloxetine was the most reviewed drug with 4,735 reviews, commonly prescribed for managing depression and anxiety. Other top-reviewed drugs include Pregabalin (3,066 reviews), Lisinopril (2,867 reviews), followed by Amitriptyline, Simvastatin, Levofloxacin, Naproxen, Ciprofloxacin, Atorvastatin, and Amoxicillin-Pot Clavulanate respectively.

4.	**Analyse the trend of satisfaction rates based on drug dosage form (cream, capsule, tablet, injection, etc.):** 
Based on the line chart, patients showed a preference for certain dosage forms. Creams and liquids (suspensions, syrups) were preferred, followed by tablets, capsules, and injections. This suggests that non-oral forms might be more convenient or better tolerated by some patients.

5.	**What is the relationship between the ease of use and the effectiveness of drugs?**
The line chart shows a strong positive correlation, with ease of use and effectiveness both rated highly (mostly around 4.9 out of 5). This indicates that drugs that are easier to use are often perceived as more effective.

6.	**Which condition has the highest average drug price (Top 10 conditions)?** 
Pancreatic Cancer (Adenocarcinoma of the Pancreas) had the highest average drug price at 2,543 cedis, followed by conditions such as Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Infantile Autism.

## Conclusion
This dataset provides valuable insights into the performance of various drugs based on customer reviews, prices, and types. The analysis can help healthcare professionals and researchers understand trends and preferences, ultimately improving drug prescriptions and patient satisfaction.
